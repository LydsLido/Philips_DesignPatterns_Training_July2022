Let us build a sales reporting application for the management of a store with multiple departments. 
The features of the application include:

Users should be able to select a specific department they are interested in.
Upon selecting a department, two types of reports are to be displayed:
Monthly report — A list of all transactions for the current month for the selected department.
YTD sales chart — A chart showing the year-to-date sales for the selected department by month. 
Whenever a different department is selected, 
both reports should be refreshed with the data for the currently selected department
