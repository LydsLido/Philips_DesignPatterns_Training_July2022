Let us consider an online job site that receives XML data files from different employers 
with current openings in their organizations. When the number of vacancies is small, 
employers can enter details online. 
When the number of vacancies is large, employers upload details in the form of an XML file. 
Once the XML file is received, it needs to be parsed and processed. 
Let us assume the XML file to have the following details:

a.Job title
b.Minimum qualifications
c.Medical insurance
d.Dental insurance
e.Vision care
f.Minimum number of hours of work
g.Paid vacation
h.Employer name
i.Employer address 

In general, Details from (c) through (i) are all considered 
being the same for all jobs posted by a given employer. 
Apply the required pattern to design the process of parsing the input XML file and 
creating different JOB objects
